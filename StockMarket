Good evening, folks! This is Ruben, bringing you the latest and greatest news from the stock market, where the numbers are high, the risks are even higher, and the wallets are emptier than ever before.

It seems that cryptocurrency is still all the rage. Bitcoin hit a new high today, causing some investors to jump on board the crypto train. However, others are wary of the unpredictable nature of this digital currency.

Meanwhile, some old-school investors are sticking to tried-and-true stocks, like Apple and Amazon. They may not be as exciting as the latest tech startup, but they have a proven track record of success.

Investors are scratching their heads, wondering if they should buy, sell, or just go back to bed. The market is about as stable as a game of Jenga played by a group of hyperactive toddlers.

And finally, in a bizarre turn of events, it turns out that the stock market itself is not immune to the effects of climate change. Reports have shown that the rising temperatures have caused the numbers on the stock ticker to melt, leaving investors scrambling to decipher whether they're seeing a 6 or a 9. One thing's for sure, though - if you're looking to invest in ice cream or sunscreen, now might be the time to strike.
